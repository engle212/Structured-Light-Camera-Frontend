# Structured-Light-Camera
The Structured Light Camera will scan objects and output the 3D model as a CAD compatible file. The system will use an integrated circuit and be a compact device with modular design. This repository will house the code that will operate the system on the frontend.

To start the web application, use the following command in the directory that houses the slc-flask and slcapp folders.
```text
python -m flask --app slcapp run --debug
```
